# Image & Video Analysis and Technologies (2020-2021)

This repository contains the **programming sets** (total score: 5/5) of the **Image & Video Analysis and Technologies** lecture series held by NTUA during the 8th semester (Spring 2021) of the ECE undergraduate course. The problems involve classic image analysis topics and basic neural network architectures. In short:

- RGB model - Multiscale Analysis - Laplacian Pyramids - Image Histograms
- Interest point detection and Motion tracking using (mainly) Harris Detector and Lucas-Kanade Mathod
- Deep Learning concepts and famous architectures (LeNet, AlexNet, VGG)

Due to the large size of the files, it is most likely that the code will not load on GitHub. However, you can view it online here:
